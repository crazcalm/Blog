I having been thinking about blogging again, but I couldn't get over my axiety of starting over. After weeks of thinking about it and doing nothing, I decided to try to get my github.io page working. I mean, the site has been up for nearly a decade, but I have not touched it in 5 years, which means I have not built it in 5 years.

Hugo has changed. The current version of Hugo cannot build this blog, but, if you scroll through the hugo releases long enough, you can find binaries from 2018 ([v0.50](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.50)).

Anyway, that's what I'm doing.

From me to me, I wish you luck!
