## Window VM's

As a linux user, I do not have any Windows machines. However, every couple of years I do need the Windows operating system for either testing browser support, making sure my code runs on Windows, etc. And, even though I have downloaded Windows VMs plenty of times, I always forget which website has them. Thus, this blog.

## Microsoft's Developer Website
The full url is [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/).

This website will allow you to download VMs for different versions of the Windows operating systems. Personally, I have only used the virtualbox VMs, but I am sure that the other ones work just as well.
