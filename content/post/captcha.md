## I am not a ROBOT!!!

I am currently in China and I already do not have access to a lot of sites (Thanks China!). Now Google is blocking the few sites that I do have access to with their Captcha interface! I have no access to Google, so I have no way of completing the Captcha! Given that implementing a captcha is standard practice in tech, I just lost access to the rest of the Western World...
