&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a horrible memory. If I meet 10 people at a party, I might remember 2 of their names. Recently, I started teaching English in China, and I now have 300+ students. In the spirit of facing my memory problem head on, wrote a programmatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;flash-cards-app&#34;&gt;Flash Cards App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;image src=&#34;https://crazcalm.github.io/blog/img/flashcard_app.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built my own flashcard app! You can find the project on Github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/crazcalm/flash-cards&#34;&gt;https://github.com/crazcalm/flash-cards&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, I used Golang to build a terminal application that reads a csv file and turns that content into flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After building this tool, I thought &amp;ldquo;Wow, this is great! Maybe I can do something similar to solve other classroom problems!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-repo-of-class-related-tools&#34;&gt;A Repo of Class Related Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then create a repo called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/crazcalm/students-csv&#34;&gt;student-csv&lt;/a&gt; to house random tools that I would use in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have tool that selects a random student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a tool to break the class into groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a tool to take attendance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these tools are awesome on my Linux box, but this school only uses Window&amp;rsquo;s 7 machines in class. For the past month, I have been telling myself that porting these apps to Windows should be easy. It is just a terminal app. How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I actually tried porting it last night&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-oversight&#34;&gt;The Oversight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was right, porting these apps to Windows was easy. The only thing that I had to modify were the system command calls. In each of these apps, I send to clear command to the terminal to clear the screen. On Windows, that command is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The oversight was that the Window&amp;rsquo;s command prompt does not support utf-8&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in China! All my students are Chinese people with Chinese names! Thus, even though all of these apps work fine, I cannot use them in class because the Window&amp;rsquo;s command prompt cannot print out Chinese Characters!&lt;/p&gt;
