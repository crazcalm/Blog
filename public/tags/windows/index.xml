      <description>The Problem I have a horrible memory. If I meet 10 people at a party, I might remember 2 of their names. Recently, I started teaching English in China, and I now have 300+ students. In the spirit of facing my memory problem head on, wrote a programmatic solution.
Flash Cards App I built my own flashcard app! You can find the project on Github at https://github.com/crazcalm/flash-cards. In summary, I used Golang to build a terminal application that reads a csv file and turns that content into flashcards.</description>

      <description>Window VM&amp;rsquo;s As a linux user, I do not have any Windows machines. However, every couple of years I do need the Windows operating system for either testing browser support, making sure my code runs on Windows, etc. And, even though I have downloaded Windows VMs plenty of times, I always forget which website has them. Thus, this blog.
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Developer Website The full url is https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/.
This website will allow you to download VMs for different versions of the Windows operating systems.</description>
