      <description>What is Embedding? The talk given by Sean Kelly on Embedding is the best resource I have found for explaining it.
In summary, Embedding, in golang, is the rules governing the ability to place one struct or interface within another struct or interface and, from the outer struct or interface, call the exported fields of the inner struct or interface.
In terms of creating a custom file server, why is this important?</description>

      <description>Why? Why do such a thing I have no good reason&amp;hellip; I was poking around in the golang net/http package one night and came across triv.go. Triv.go (triv is short for trivial) is a file filled with trivial server examples.
One of those examples was a file server. When I pointed my browser at that file server, I saw all of my dot files. At the time, I was sharing my home directory, which is filled with dot files.</description>
