      <description>The Issue While in China, I do not have access to Google services, websites, or platforms.

      <description>What I was prepared for: When planning a move to China, we all think of the obvious things we will lose the ability to use; All Google products, Facebook, Whats App, Twitter, Instagram, etc. I have known people who have purchased VPNs so that they could continue using those services, but I am not one of those people.
What I did not expect: Distance issues The biggest issue I have ran into has been the physical distance between China and the Western world.</description>
